# Film tracking database & app

This is a personal project I started to learn more about implementing a Django project from scratch.

I really enjoy watching films and have always wanted something similar to 'Goodreads'
in order to track what I've watched and what I want to watch.

When I started the project, I had completed [MDN's Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django)
so most of my initial ideas and work was based on that.

This project is still very much a work in progress.
Please contact me with any questions or thoughts!
